## Create the cache of a matrix and return inverse matrix if already computed previously
## Assumption: matrix supplied is always invertible.

## Create a matrix and cache the inverse
## test function to save compute time

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {

}


## Write a short comment describing this function

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
        ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
}
